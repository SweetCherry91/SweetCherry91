<h1>Hello you &#128075;</h1> 
<div><p>In the online world I'm better known as SweetCherry. In the real world my name is Nadia, nice to meet you!</p>
<p>I’m interested in back-end developing, little experience with BeInformed, alongside GDPR and business law. In my personal life I enjoy doing sports such as running and muscle training.</p>
<p>I’m currently learning more about IT &amp; in my private life I'm discovering how to renovate my house.</p>
<p>I’m looking to collaborate on IT projects. Start with an idea and create something amazing is the best feeling! Additionally in my continued existence I enjoy collaborating with a glass of wine. &#128523;</p>
